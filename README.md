Wine Consumption in France followed by the Wine Recommender

The wine industry in France is a cornerstone of the country’s cultural and economic landscape. Known for its diverse wine regions and high-quality production, France remains a global leader in wine exportation, consumption, and production. With its rich history and tradition, French wine holds a special place in the hearts of wine enthusiasts around the world.

In this project, I aim to develop a comprehensive analysis of the wine market in France. By leveraging various data collection methods, including web scraping, API integration, and database management, I seek to provide detailed insights into wine consumption, export, import, production and price tendencies.

Goal
The goal of this project is to:
• Provide insights into wine export, import, production and consumption patterns
• Try to develop a recommendation system that suggests wines based on meal images

Objective
The objective is to collect, clean, and analyze data related to wine production, consumption, and prices in France. By doing so, I will develop a robust database that provides valuable insights into the wine industry. The final deliverable will include detailed reports and visualizations that highlight key trends and patterns in the wine market and a web application for wine recommendations.

Use Case
The primary use case for this project is to develop a system that can analyze and recommend wines to users based on their meal choices. The recommendation system will utilize image recognition to identify meals and suggest the best matching wines, thereby enriching the dining experience. This system will be particularly useful for wine enthusiasts, restaurants, and retailers who want to offer personalized wine suggestions to their customers.
